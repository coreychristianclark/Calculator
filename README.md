Project: Calculator

This basic calculator is my second web development project. Admittedly, I did not create this from scratch -- I followed along with a tutorial.
It was an extremely enlightening process to follow along with since I got to see how concepts are implemented, good practices, and finding
out features/codes I didn't even know existed at the time.

In the future, I plan to come back to this and personalize it a bit (add features, play with the interface, etc.). For now, I am glad
to just have a basic, functioning calculator.
